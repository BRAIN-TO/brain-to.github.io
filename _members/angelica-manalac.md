Angelica Manalac is an incoming MSc student in Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto. She received her BSc in Medical Physics (Co-op) at McMaster University in 2020, with high distinction. During her undergraduate studies, she was a part of many different projects in the field of biophotonics. One project investigated the light propagation in breast tissue in order to obtain tissue optical properties and to characterize breast cancer risk. More recently, she was involved in executing Monte Carlo simulations of UVC light propagation for filtered face respirators to investigate their applicability for UV germicidal inactivation.

Angelica's MSc project will look at extracting characteristics of vasculature using gradient and spin-echo MRI.
