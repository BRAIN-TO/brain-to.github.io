Brian Nghiem is pursuing a Master’s degree in the Department of Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto (U of T). He is interested in investigating applications of deep learning to carry out motion correction in MR neuroimaging. He received his Bachelor of Science degree at U of T in 2019, having completed the Biological Physics Specialist program with high distinction.

Outside of academics, Brian has maintained a life-long love for music. He is an active musician whose recent on-campus performances include the Women In Science and Engineering (WISE) 2019 Gala and occasional appearances with the Appassionata classical music group. He was previously a piano instructor with the Musical Minds Community Outreach program and the assistant director of the Innis College Choir at U of T.

Patient motion compromises the quality of MR images, resulting in artifacts that obscure potentially important features of the brain. State-of-the art retrospective correction methods attempt to estimate patient motion either by acquiring additional information during the scan time, or by solving a computationally-expensive optimization problem. More recent approaches involve the use of Deep Learning (DL) to improve motion correction by leveraging image priors learned during network training. Brian is focusing on the use of DL approaches to account for higher-order physics effects associated with motion. He is also interested in researching optimization methods and reference-free image quality metrics.
