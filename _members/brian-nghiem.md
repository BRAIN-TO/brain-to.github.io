Brian Nghiem is PhD candidate in the Department of Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto. He received a BSc degree in Biological Physics from the University of Toronto in 2019. He is interested in investigating applications of deep learning to carry out motion correction in MR neuroimaging. 

Patient motion compromises the quality of MR images, resulting in artifacts that obscure potentially important features of the brain. State-of-the art motion correction methods require specialized sequences or equipment, which limit their widespread adoption into clinical practice. Brian is developing retrospective motion correction approaches that can be applied to standard MRI protocols to salvage corrupted data. Brian is focusing on the use of MRI physics-guided deep learning for robust and efficient retrospective motion correction. He is also interested in researching optimization methods and reference-free image quality metrics.
