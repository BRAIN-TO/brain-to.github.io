Fatemeh Bagheri is pursuing a Master’s degree in the department of Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto (U of T). She received her Bachelor of Engineering in Biomedical Engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Iran. Her research interests include Medical Imaging (MRI), Image Processing, Deep Learning, and Neuroscience.

It is essential to obtain MR images of patients with implants at magnetic fields of lower strength like 0.5 instead of 3 Tesla. As a result, the quality of the images decreases, and lower quality may lead to an inaccurate clinical diagnosis, potentially resulting in inappropriate medical treatment. The solution to this problem could be a technique that enhances low field MR images to their higher field representation. Fatemeh’s MSc project is to predict 3 Tesla MR images from 0.5 Tesla MR images utilizing a Deep Learning approach.
