I'm an interdisciplinary scientist in the BRAIN-TO lab working on developing acquisition and analysis methods for neuroscientific and clinical applications of MRI.

My background is in engineering biotechnology and pre-clinical neurosciences. I received my Masters degree in Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience at Maastricht University in 2014 wherein my dissertation focussed on the characterising the neuroanatomical properties of human hippocampal subfields using ultra-high-resolution 7T MRI. Following this, my [doctoral work](https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/en/publications/laminar-fmri-at-ultra-high-fields-acquisition-and-analysis-strate) at Maastricht involved developing acquisition and analysis approaches for sub-millimetre resolution functional MRI using BOLD and perfusion contrasts at 7 and 9.4 T with the goal to resolve layer-specific properties of the human visual cortex. My post-doctoral work in the MR-Methods group included ultra-high field high-resolution multi-modal fMRI applications at 7T and 9.4T in collaboration with Dr. David Feinberg (University of California, Berkeley, USA) as well as several international collaborative projects with the UC Lovain (Belgium), Western University (Canada), Hahn Institute for MRI (Germany) and Sungkyunkwan University (S. Korea).

I joined the BRAIN-TO Lab as a Post-doctoral researcher in 2021. My office can be found at the Slaight Family Centre for Advanced MRI, Toronto Western Hospital where I work on advanced imaging methods & clinical applications.

Outside of research, I enjoy natural history, epic fantasy and graphic novels, I actively follow soccer football, I’m an avid gamer (PC, PS5 & tabletop), I tinker with my Raspberry Pi and other gadgets, and love to travel when I can afford to.
