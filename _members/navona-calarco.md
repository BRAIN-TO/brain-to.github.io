Navona joined the BRAIN-TO lab as a PhD student in Medical Biophysics in 2022. Previously, she completed an MSc in Medical Science, working with Dr. Aristotle Voineskos at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. Her research interest is to apply emerging techniques in medical imaging and statistics to understand what goes wrong in the brain in psychiatric illness and neurodegenerative disorders. The ultimate goal of this work is to illuminate early markers of disease, and identify treatment targets.

Navona’s PhD research investigates the claustrum, often described as the most mysterious structure in the human brain. The mystery arises as a consequence of the claustrum’s complex shape: it is a thin sheet of neurons ensconced deep within white matter, which has hampered investigation via conventional brain imaging methods. But, non-invasive, in vivo detection is afforded --in principle-- by recent breakthroughs in ultra-high field MRI. Navona’s first project examines if 7-Tesla images acquired at .4mm and .7mm isotropic resolution permit reconstruction along the claustrum’s entire extent, via comparison to a ‘gold-standard’ reference manually segmented on the postmortem BigBrain dataset. Subsequent projects will proceed step-wise to describe claustral structure and function in healthy and patient populations. Discoveries here may enrich understanding of the neural basis of higher-order cognitive processes, with possible implications for transdiagnostic interventions.
