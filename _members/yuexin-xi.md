Yuexin Xi joined the lab as a Research Technician at the Slaight Family Centre for Advanced MRI of the University Health Network in 2022. She is now a PhD Candidate at the Medical Biophysics Department at the University of Toronto. Her research interests focus on the preprocessing and analysis of fMRI data to improve the robustness and efficiency of collaboration by providing high-quality data. Her current work is to develop a biologically and physiologically informed laminar fMRI model within the dynamic causal modelling framework to study laminar-specific connections non-invasively in human brain.
