Labeeb Talukder is currently pursuing a Master’s of Science degree in Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto. He completed his honor’s bachelor’s of science at the University of Toronto Scarborough campus, receiving his Specialist Co-op degree in Neuroscience. During his undergraduate degree, a part of his research experience involved programming robotic exoskeletons for gait rehabilitation in patients with multiple sclerosis. This was done to assess the safety and efficacy for the clinical applications of technology originally licensed for military purposes. His undergraduate thesis involved studying audiovisual synchrony perception in infancy, utilizing infrared eye trackers to detect fixations patterns in response to synchronous and asynchronous audiovisual stimuli played at both high and low frequencies. He served as an emergency medical responder at the Scarborough Campus, a 24/7 campus-based first-aid response team. In his spare time, he enjoys staying active, with a particular interest in weightlifting.

His current research involves bridging fMRI research and artificial intelligence. Recent advances in computer vision have yielded the potential for neural networks to act as interpretive tools for understanding brain dynamics. This research will involve enhancing the biological plausibility of these neural networks and how we can use them as working models of the brain. Training these models on BOLD responses from fMRI has the potential to provide us with an unprecedented understanding of these underlying patterns of functional connectivity. A working model of the healthy brain will have important clinical applications for modeling neuropathological activity in the brain.
