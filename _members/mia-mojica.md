Mia studied Applied Mathematics from 2006-2013 at the University of the Philippines. She has recently completed her PhD in Modelling and Computational Science (Ontario Tech University).

Her research interests lie in the intersection of numerical analysis, mathematical imaging, and its applications. Since 2009, she has been working on inverse problems in image reconstruction. More recently, for her PhD thesis, she developed image registration methods geared towards biomedical applications.

Mia will perform data analysis for the Slaight Family Centre for Advanced MRI. Her future projects will involve developing an MRI processing pipeline for Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping in the context of movement disorders and a pipeline for the detection of subtle blood-brain barrier disruption in epilepsy.
