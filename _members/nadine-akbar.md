I completed my M.Sc. and Ph.D. through the Institute of Medical Science Department at the University of Toronto. The major focus of my graduate training was determining the neuroimaging (structural and functional MRI) correlates of cognitive function in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). I then conducted two fellowships (Kessler Foundation in New Jersey, and then Queen’s University in Kingston) focused on the rehabilitation of fatigue in persons with MS. My fellowship at Kessler Foundation demonstrated how exercise training can induce changes to MRI functional connectivity of neural networks associated with cognitive fatigue. I have a continued interest in the use of neuroimaging tools to examine the neural mechanisms behind symptoms and rehabilitative interventions in various clinical populations.

My overall goal is to develop neuroimaging analysis tools that will help earlier detect and better treat cognitive, psychiatric and physical symptoms in various clinical disorders. We are at a time where there is a wealth of publicly available health-related and neuroimaging data that can be used by researchers to answer questions to better improve clinical care. My more specific goals are the development of analysis pipelines emphasizing the use of machine learning for single-subject structural and functional MRI prediction of cognitive and clinical variables in healthy and diseased populations using these large publicly available neuroimaging datasets.
