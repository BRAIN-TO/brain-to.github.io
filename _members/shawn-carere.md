Shawn Carere is an MSc student in the Department of Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto. He received his BASc in Electrical Engineering from Queen’s University with First Class Honours as well as was the recipient of the Ontario Professional Engineers Gold Medal upon graduation. Throughout his undergraduate degree Shawn gained relevant experience in machine learning and biomedical signal/image processing. He was an inaugural member, and later Director of Design, for QMIND, Canada’s largest undergraduate organization for artificial intelligence, now with over 250 members. He was also the the Technical Director for Merlin Neurotech, where he developed an API for real-time EEG signal processing. His capstone project, under the supervision of Dr. Shideh Kabiri Ameri, used machine learning to identify, classify and visualize heart arrhythmias in real-time using a portable ECG sensor.

**Deep Image Reconstruction from Human Brain Activity using Capsule Networks.**
Shawn’s research is focused on designing new deep neural networks for reconstructing images from brain activity recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). His current project intends to combine capsule networks, a novel alternative to CNN’s, and StyleGAN, a novel generator network, into a unique autoencoder network.
