Kâmil Uludağ studied from 1992 till 1997 Physics at the Technical University of Berlin. He completed his Ph.D. in Physics in 2003 on Near-Infrared Optical Spectroscopy (Humboldt University, Berlin) and moved for a postdoc position to the Center for Functional MRI (UCSD, San Diego, USA) to work on the physiological and physical basis of functional MRI. In 2004, he was appointed Head of Human Brain Imaging group at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Tübingen, Germany. From June 2010 to December 2018, he was Associate Professor in the Faculty of Psychology & Neuroscience and Head of the Department of Cognitive Neuroscience continuing his work on the fundamentals of fMRI utilizing the new Ultra-High Field human MRI scanners (7 and 9.4 Tesla). Since May 2019, he is Full Professor at the Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto.

Dr. Uludağ is on the editorial board of five neuroimaging journals, served from 2011 to 2013 as Annual Meeting Committee Member of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Medicine (ISMRM) and was elected Chair of the Current Issues of Brain Function study group. He recently edited a textbook “Functional MRI: from Nuclear Spins to Brain Functions” (Publisher: Springer).

Dr. Uludağ’s laboratory combines artificial intelligence approaches with 1.5 and 3T MRI big data in order to answer fundamental neuroscience questions and to develop biomarkers for clinical applications. Furthermore, he uses deep learning methods and generative models to improve the effectivity of MR image acquisition and reconstruction, promising to advance our understanding of the physical and physiological basis of MRI. As Co-Director of the Slaight Family Centre for Advanced MRI at the Toronto Western Hospital, Dr. Uludağ advises the clinical research groups in their studies of the brain and spine.
